            Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and
            take up the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of
            course) for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section
            really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set
            its height to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause
            scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure
            its background color is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content.
            (Hint: don’t forget to have an element with a class=’container’ or
            class=’container-fluid’ wrapping your grid. Remember that to have the grid
            do something “always”, i.e., no matter what browser window size, use the
            col-xs-... classes. In this case, since we want the section to take up the
            entire row, use col-xs-12.)
